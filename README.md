Above is the incorrect code

Changes made are as follows:
Line 1: Added : after the definition of function
Line 2: Removed ;
Line 3: Removed one * as power function is given by ** 
Line 3:Changed targ to target
Line 5: Changed ranges to range
Line 6: Changed ranges to range
Line 5: Added : after for loop
Line 6: Added : after for loop
Line 7 Removed one * as power function is given by ** between a and 3
Line 7 Removed one * as power function is given by ** between b and 3
Line 7:Changed targ to target
Line &: Added :
Line 8:Changed sol to solutions
Line 9:Changed sol to solutions
Line 11: Removed ,
Line 12: Removed ,
Line 12: Changed printf to print
Line 13: Changed pair to pairs
Line 13: Added :
Line 14: Changed printf to print
Line 14: Changed 1728 to 1729
